Paycheck calculator

I designed a very basic paycheck calculator for myself using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. Most of the time I end up doing these calculations the week before payday on my phone's calculator, so I figured there was a need for it. It delivers near accurate results with a relatively small margin of error, usually estimating a very slightly smaller paycheck than one I actually receive.

For all intents and purposes, the lump percentage of taxes taken out of the paycheck is estimated to be about 15%. That's where the margin of error comes in. Tax percentage changes ever so slightly with each paycheck I receive that I had to calculate a mean for the program.
